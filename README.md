Head to the releases tab on the right and grab the version of the mod you want. Don't download the sources.jar file unless you want to add support to your mod. Make sure to install Coroutil to play with this mod.

##  How To Build (Eclipse)
- Requires Coroutil in libs folder
- Place these mods in the lib folder (Create the folder in your project folder if it doesn't exist)
- run "gradlew eclipse genEclipseRuns"
  This may not work as I did struggle to build this myself

- MrCrayfish's Vehicle Mod - Vehicles get picked up (Removed as of 2.8.5, will add it back in 2.8.6)
